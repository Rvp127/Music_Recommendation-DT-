# Music_Recommendation-DT-
The dataset consists of objects with features like 'age', 'gender' and class features which describe each user. The class refers to the genre of music that is preferred by the user. Using the dataset, we train a model based on decision tree classification which relates and classifies the preferred genre to the age and gender of the user. Using this model we will be able to predict the preferred genre using the features said above. The dataset consists of 5 different classes namely ‘Acoustic’, ’Classical’, ‘Dance’, ‘Hip-Hop’ and ‘Jazz’. The platform and language used to build the model is ‘Jupyter Notebook’ and Python 3.0 respectively. The dataset is mainly used for demonstration purpose only as in an actual music recommendation system(Eg: Spotify) There will be thousands of data and features available. To understand in simple terms this dataset was created by me. 
Please do refer the project report as the methodology explains the code better.
